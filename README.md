## Reflection

- Searching for APIs to fit specific design was a small obstacle at first. For future projects, we will identify potentially useful APIs **early** and let available resources have a larger influence on the planning/development process.

---

## Future Development

- Integrate calendar feature for user to access assignments/due dates

- Option for user to narrow results by school level/grades offered

- Update YouTube search to display multiple video results or a full playlist
